# xdc
An R package for decomposing Gaussian mixture distributions into potentially overlapping components.

The xdc package provides four categories of functions:

- xdc.ma, using the latent mixture-based method for moderator estimation

- xdc.dc, decomposing a Gaussian mixture

- xdc.plot.mx, plotting one or more mixture distributions (and comparing it with other data distributions)

- xdc.hist.mx and xdc.hist.data, computing the histogram of a mixture distribution or from the observed data. Note that histogram is the focal structure we use to decompose a mixture distribution
